## Question 2

The region us-east-1 is located in North Virginia.
It is the region closest to me and the one I deploy
to most often.

An AWS region is a physical geographic location in the
world that contains a cluster of AWS data centers.

An AWS Availability Zone (AZ) is a distinct location
within an AWS Region that are engineered to be isolated
from failures in other Availability Zones. A single
AWS Region contains multiple Availability Zones.

The us-east-1 region contains the following AZs:
us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c, us-east-1d, us-east-1e
